# Data and Knowledge Modeling

Representing and codifying knowledge -- using a combination of logical constraints and notions of classes, instances, and types -- is at the heart of data science.  Whether nodes and edges in a graph, tables in a spreadsheet, or feature matrices in machine learning -- one must be able to codify data and its properties in a structured fashion.  This module covers the essentials of knowledge representation, knowledge graphs, and, most prominently, schema design.

Addtional introductory material are added that introduces data types for students new to Python programming.
