# Machine Learning

A key part of data science -- and the part most people immediately gravitate towards -- is the use of machine learning techniques to build descriptive or predictive models of data.  This module covers the basics of unsupervised and supervised machine learning.

For those students new to machine learning and coming from other disciplines, an introductory lecture and additional introductory material on classification, assosiation rules, clustering, and linear regression will help them better understand the content of the other lectures.
