# Open Data Science for All Ethics

A good data scientist needs to understand the ethical issues surrounding the data they obtain and use, the algorithms they employ, and its impact on people.  This module gives an overview of several ethical issues, including privacy and informed consent, ownership and intellectual property, bias in algorithms, and fairness.  The material is presented at a basic level.
