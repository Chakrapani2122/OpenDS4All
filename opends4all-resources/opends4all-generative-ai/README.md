# Generative AI

A paradigm shift is currently taking place in AI driven by generative AI and foundation models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3). Foundation models are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used for different tasks, with minimal fine-tuning. 

For those learners new to generative AI, the lectures on machine learning and deep learning will help them better understand the content of these lectures.
