# Foundations

This set of modules establishes foundational knowledge for the OpenDS4All curriculum.

Initially we include an overview of computer architecture, appropriate as a prerequisite to discussing algorithmic performance.

For those students unfamiliar with probability theory and very basic statistical notions, additional material on probability distributions and summary statistics are added to help them better understand the content of the other lectures.
