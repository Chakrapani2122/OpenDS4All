## Notes
- OpenDS4All Close-out Meeting
  - Decision was made to put OpenDS4All in maintenance mode due to the following reasons
    - Reached many of its original goals
    - Not able to achieve general adoption and attract enough contributors
    - Content is aging
    - Further development is deemed unnecessary or ill-advised
  - Occasional bug fixes, patches and day-to-day maintenance are still done
  - Technical Steering committee dissolved
  - Next step
    - Prof Florence D. Hudson, Executive Director, Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub, Columbia University will be approached to
      discuss whether the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub and the National Student Data Corps would like to take on the role of
      managing OpenDS4All
